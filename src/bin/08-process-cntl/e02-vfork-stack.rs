/// Exercise 8.2: Recall the typical arrangement of memory in Figure 7.6.
/// Because the stack frames corresponding to each function call are usually
/// stored in the stack, and because after a vfork the child runs in the
/// address space of the parent, what happens if the call to vfork is from a
/// function other than main and the child does a return from this function
/// after the vfork? Write a test program to verify this, and draw a picture
/// of whatâ€™s happening.
///
/// Takeaway: this is a good showcase why vfork is very very VERY
/// dangerous. What happens is that the process which exits the function
/// tears down the stack frame, pulling the rog out under the other processes
/// feet. If he then tries to access a stack var, this is bye bye birdie.
