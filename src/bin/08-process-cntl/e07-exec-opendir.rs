/// Exercise 8.7: We mentioned in Section 8.10 that POSIX.1 requires open directory streams to be
/// closed across an exec. Verify this as follows: call opendir for the root directory, peek at
/// your systemâ€™s implementation of the DIR structure, and print the close-on-exec flag.
/// Then open the same directory for reading, and print the close-on-exec flag.
///
/// From the doc: POSIX.1 specifically requires that open directory streams (recall the opendir
/// function from Section 4.22) be closed across an exec. This is normally done by the opendir
/// function calling fcntl to set the close-on-exec flag for the descriptor corresponding to
/// the open directory stream.
///
/// $ e07-exec-opendir
/// close-on-exec is set
/// close-on-exec is not set
