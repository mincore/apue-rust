/// Exercise 10.12: Write a program that calls fwrite with a large buffer
/// (about one gigabyte). Before calling fwrite, call alarm to schedule a
/// signal in 1 second. In your signal handler, print that the signal was
/// caught and return. Does the call to fwrite complete? Whatâ€™s happening?
///
/// Findings:
/// - both on OSX and Linux the alarm is immediately triggered
/// - alarm doesn't stop the fwrite call, all 1GB data is written on disk still
/// - initially wanted to create the buffer with
///   `let buffer: [i8; SIZE] = [50; SIZE]` which resulted in a segfault.
///   After some debugging with strace I found out that it was failing because
///   the memory is allocated in the stack and `getrlimit(RLIMIT_STACK)` returned
///   a max stack size of 2^23 bytes -> the max size of a buffer in the stack
///   is 2^22 because some bytes are needed for the code and the other vars.
