/// Figure 10.10: Calling read with a timeout
///
/// Takeaway: First I tried with the regular `signal` function of libc
/// only to find out that the alarm signal does not interrupt the read
/// call. Digging into the C code it got obvious that the signal function
/// gets overriden by `lib/signal.c` which is a "reliable version of signal(),
/// using POSIX sigaction()". But this function gets only introduced in
/// Figure 10.18. This was quite misleading IMO.
///
/// $ f10-read-timeout 2>&1
/// read error!
/// ERROR: return code 1
